Discord desktop app themed portfolio website made using svelte ! 

![Kurizu-dev](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83665497/177132064-36991c91-3c5b-4971-9cd8-785a04134d42.png)

## Code
Just clone the repo and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
Then run `npm run dev` to start the server

All the code is in the `src/components` folder under 3 main folders:
- `channels`: contains all the channels related stuff
- `content`: the main page content
- `sidebar`: sidebar for servers 

If you want to use this project to make your own website feel free to do so :) 

If you have any feedback / bugs / suggestions, feel free to open an issue on github or contact me on discord.
